                Solving the biggest need of hunters: the story behind Sound Barrier

                It all started to solve a problem, a frustration I felt every time I went hunting,
                every time I walked in the woods, set a stand, or scouted an area. There was this one
                thing I felt i could not control: the noise I made.  Big or small, I always made noise.
                I had just accepted it, and it seemed other hunters had just accepted it too.  It was
                that unspoken thing, like they had embraced it, and felt it was not a big deal. Deep down
                I knew it was a big deal, and it was killing me.  I found I was not alone, that other
                hunters felt the same way and it was a struggle for all hunters, in fact 85% of hunters know
                it is a big problem (according to sound barrier surveys, with the other 15% I think being
                in denial).

                I remember one hunt in particular where I was taking down a stand and climbing stick.
                They are great tools, but man are there a lot of ways to make noise with them.  As I made
                the inevitable clang, a large, heavy sounding deer jumped from its bed  about 40 yards away
                and crashed off into the distance.  I knew I had ruined another spot.   Out of my perfectionism,
                for striving to be better, I found getting past a deer’s sense of hearing was the main way I
                could drastically improve my chances of success, the one big thing that no one had a cure for.
                So I set out to find it.. knowledge, the cure.. I researched how deer hear.  I searched for
                answers about what a noise means to them and how it really affects them.  I wanted something real,
                the science that was indisputable.  Theories, strategies, and products were tested and developed.
                I went to the best books, scientists, and found the one scientist who had actually studied deer
                hearing in depth, and I learned from him and his testing.  By applying my physics background I
                found real solutions.  A core group of guys, friends, got on board with this when they saw a video
                I made testing my theories on wild deer.  It was for real, and through this quest for being a better
                hunter, by doing something that hadn’t been done before in any significant way, Sound Barrier was born.
                That’s what Sound Barrier is about, that’s why we get up and do what we do, to fill a need for all hunters
                and get past a deer’s last defense of hearing.  We help others reach a truly new level of stealth.  We’re
                pioneering something new, and very challenging, but its well worth helping hunters never be heard again!

                I grew up hunting.  Its really in my blood.  Hunting and sports, that’s what I’ve lived for really my whole
                life.  The challenge, the competition, and great chance to fail which brings the even greater chance to
                possibly win.  And that makes it feel great, really great.  All the hard work, sweat, blood, that comes
                down to one moment.  I grew up and live in Michigan, which has a great hunting heritage, but also is a
                very hard place to hunt with all the hunters and pressure the deer face.  I guess that made me pay
                attention to details.  Even from an early age my deep, deep desire to win, or not to lose, has driven
                me to exel at sports or whatever I did.  Not that I always did, or do, but somewhere that desire got
                planted in me, and really has compelled me against all things that say no, compel me to somehow find a
                way to win and make things happen others couldn’t or didn’t try.  I’m also a perfectionist, to a fault,
                but that sometimes comes in handy when you’re trying to be excellent in something, whatever it is.

                So noise I made while hunting or hanging stands bothered me, really bothered me.  My perfectionism tried to take
                over, but it was hard.  I have a physics background, so I know its just a fact of science that things make noise,
                vibrations cause noise and these travel great distances.  So I took that angle, that fact, and tried to flip it to
                my advantage.   And knowledge is power, so I searched to learn everything I could about deer hearing.  I learned a lot.
                You’ll find this in the sound science section of our website and a lot of our articles and videos.  I mean its just
                science, but nobody was doing this and I said, “why not me?”  And the reality is I saw that it was a huge need of hunters.

                Frankly, I saw that hunters could realistically get past only 2 of the 3 main senses deer have that keep them from success.
                It was kind of a joke to me, with all the products and hype out there saying that somehow by getting past 2/3rds of a
                whitetail’s senses (66% I say- eyes with camo, and nose with scent products) would somehow be all they needed to be successful
                and somehow make them a stealth god.  But it wasn’t, and with the other 1/3rd of their senses there, I saw a huge opportunity
                and need to help myself, and other hunters.  So that’s what I, we, are doing at Sound Barrier.  The quest for 100% stealth.
                Really, its about filling a need that’s been long ignored in hunting circles, and long overdue to be addressed for me and all
                other hunters.  In my mind its really the only way to actually, drastically help us hunters reach a new level.  That’s what we’re
                doing with this knowledge, the sound advice, and the products we’re developing.  Meeting a true need, not jumping on a bandwagon,
                but looking at the science, and filling a big need.  Its been tough, maybe that’s what has attracted me to it, but that’s what’s
                so great about it too!
